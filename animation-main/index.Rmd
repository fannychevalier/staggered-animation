Smooth animated transitions, where a graphic display changes continuously in time, are increasingly common in modern graphical interfaces. They are more appealing than still images, feel more realistic, and usually improve the aesthetics of user interfaces. Beyond their compelling nature, animations are powerful tools that can be used for various purposes. 

Despite their popularity, animations are still largely under-comprehended as a cognitive aid tool. What makes a good, effective animation that improves the usability of graphical interfaces remains unclear. These works aim to increase our understanding of animation in user interface, its roles, benefits and limitations.
